        <h3>here we can see how we should be preserve our natural resources and also we be always be grateful with what we got.  When people ''go green,'' they are practicing environmental awareness. The term means exactly what you expect it to: being aware of the natural environment and making choices that benefit--rather than hurt--the earth. In recent years, environmental awareness has gained increased attention. It is fair to say it has become a bit of a trend: from environmentally friendly tiny homes to organic food, environmental awareness is a hot topic. However, it is nothing new and it ought to be more than just a passing fad because of its importance. Let's dig deeper and learn more about environmental awareness.</h3>

              <h3>"We must do whatever small changes we can to save our home our planet earth.every year the temperature raises by 1.5 degrees celsius. if this continues the polar ice will melt and the sea level will increase.we prevent this by turing off the car engine while stoping for the signal.using less plastic, converting to healthier and eco-friendly resources like hydrofuel and solar and windmills. we can reduce the use of plastic as it takes millons of years to decompose and it is not bio-degerable and it is very harmful to the environment.instead we can use bio-begerable paper bags and other substitutes."</h3>

              <h4> People should be mindful to not waste water by leaving the faucet running while brushing teeth. Water is a valuable natural resource that we often take for granted. In many parts of the world, clean water is scarce. Being mindful of this is a huge step in demonstrating environmental awareness.

              Purchases, Recycling, and Activism
              Some people choose to buy clothing and products that contain natural fibers/materials, rather than synthetic ones. Obviously, recycling is another huge part of demonstrating environmental awareness. Still, others who are extremely passionate about this issue become activists. They might march in protests or organize rallies/events. As we can see, environmental awareness takes many forms, and each person must figure out what specific practices work for them.</h4>
